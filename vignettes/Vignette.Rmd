***Title***: I-Witness: Video Observation and Recall Shiny App

**Introduction**

The I-Witness Shiny App is a powerful tool designed to assess video observation and recall skills.
It presents users with a video clip depicting a crime, followed by a series of interactive tasks aimed at evaluating their ability to accurately describe a perpetrator, make lineup decisions, and rate their confidence in their decisions.
Before completing these tasks, there is a distractor task where they guess the country that various flags belong to.

This vignette provides a detailed overview of the app's functionality and usage.

**App Workflow**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("VignetteImages/flowchart.png")
```

See the above flowchart for a quick overview of the app's workflow.

*Video Observation:*

The app begins by displaying a welcome message and instructions to watch the video.
Users will watch one of two videos, depicting different perpetrators stealing a book from a bookshop.
They are invited to play the video and must watch it carefully.
After watching the video, they can proceed to the next panel.
In the example below, the viewer watches the video with perpetrator 1 present.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("VignetteImages/Video.png")
```

*Perpetrator Description:*

Upon clicking the arrow button, users are prompted to describe the perpetrator of the video they watched.
A text area is provided where users can enter their description in a few words.
Once they have entered their description, they can continue to the next panel.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("VignetteImages/PerpetratorDescription.png")
```

*Distractor Task:*

Next, users are presented with a series of flag images.
Each flag corresponds to a country, and users are required to name the country for each flag.
Text input fields are provided for users to enter their answers. They are given feedback after entering each of the countries, and told that they are correct or need to revisit their answers. 

Once they have completed the task, they can click the arrow button to proceed.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("VignetteImages/DistractorTask.png")
```

*Lineup Decision:*

Users are then shown a lineup image containing several individuals.
They are informed that they need to identify the person who stole the bag based on their video observation.
A text input field is provided for users to enter the number corresponding to their lineup decision.
If they believe the person is not present, they can enter 0.
After making their decision, they can click the arrow button to continue.
For each of the two videos, there is a target present and target absent lineup.

In this example, the viewer sees a lineup where the target is present (in position 8).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("VignetteImages/Lineup.png")
```

*Confidence Rating:*

Users are asked to rate their confidence in the lineup decision they made.
A slider input is provided, allowing users to select a value between 1 and 100 to represent their confidence level.
After selecting their confidence rating, they can click the arrow button to proceed.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("VignetteImages/Confidence.png")
```

*Feedback:*

Finally, users reach the feedback stage, where feedback specific to their lineup decision is displayed.

Here, the viewer made an incorrect lineup decision.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("VignetteImages/Feedback.png")
```

***Implementation***

The I-Witness Shiny App is implemented using the Shiny framework in R.
It makes use of various Shiny components and functions to create an interactive user interface and handle user interactions.

The ui function defines the layout and structure of the app's user interface.
It consists of different conditional panels that are displayed based on the user's progress through the tasks.
The panels include video playback, text entry for perpetrator description, flag identification task, lineup image display, confidence rating slider, and feedback display.

The server function handles the app's logic and reactive behavior.
It sets up resource paths for video and flag images, randomly selects a video from the available options, updates UI elements based on user interactions, and handles events triggered by button clicks or inputs.

***Installation***

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/Programming-The-Next-Step-2023/EyewitnessTask/Week4")
```

Users can install the app through this link. 

**Usage**

To run the I-Witness Shiny App, execute the runApp function.
The app will launch in a web browser and present the user interface described above.
Users can navigate through the tasks by following the instructions and interacting with the provided elements.

**Conclusion**

The I-Witness Shiny App offers an engaging and interactive platform for assessing facial recognition and recall skills.
It can be utilized in various research or educational settings where accurate description and identification of observed events take the forefront.
Researchers, educators, or individuals interested in studying eyewitness identification can leverage this app as a valuable tool.
