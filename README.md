# EyewitnessTask
Experimental shiny app in R wherein users watch a video of a crime. 
They then complete a 5-minute distractor task. 
Thereafter, they are presented with a series of lineup images. 
They are asked to select the person, if any, who they believe committed the crime. 
After making a decision, they rate their confidence that they have made an accurate choice. 
Finally, they are given feedback on their response.
